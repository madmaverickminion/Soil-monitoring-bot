# Soil Monitoring Bot

This repository contains all the work of Soil Monitoring Bot theme(eYRC-2021-22). In this theme a Soil Monitoring bot was build to be deployed on an arena which is an abstraction of actual agricultural field.
The brain of the bot was powered by an FPGA board that controls its sensors, actuators anf pick-place mechanism.

## Challenges and Learnings 

- Building the Soil Monitoring Bot from scratch
- Pick-place mechanism using electromagnet
- Wired and Wireless communication using XBEE 
- Learnt powerfull parallel processing capabilities of FPGA 
- Learnt Verilog Hardware Modelling Language.
- Learnt Path Planning Algorithms
